description: Reading assignment on combined flows. This paper is the third in a series
  of papers on developing skills in graphical integration. It will study the use of
  graphical integration to estimate the behavior of simple systems with constant and
  linearly increasing or decreasing inflows and outflows. This paper assumes you can
  estimate behaviors of models with constant, step, and variable net flows. Also,
  you should be familiar with the terms ?slope? and ?area,? and you should know how
  to calculate them for simple behaviors.
