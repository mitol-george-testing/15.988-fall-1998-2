description: 'Reading assignment on reverse graphical integration, a method which
  allows one to quickly estimate the values of a stock?s net flow based on a graph
  of the stock?s behavior over time. This technique is useful in cases where a stock?s
  behavior is known and one would like to find the associated flow behavior. This
  paper covers two simple ways to determine information about a net flow which can
  be used to draw its graph. The reader should be familiar with the concepts covered
  in Graphical Integration Exercises Part Three: Combined Flows.'
