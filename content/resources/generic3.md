description: Reading assignment. This paper introduces a structure that produces the
  behavior of overshoot and collapse and examines other behaviors that the structure
  can generate. Several examples illustrate the study of systems containing the structure.
  The exercises at the end of the paper provide the reader with an opportunity to
  see how knowledge about structure and behavior can be transferred between different
  systems.
